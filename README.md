Imbalanced datasets are a common problem in machine learning, leading to biased models and poor performance on minority classes. Methods such as resampling, cost-sensitive learning, and ensem- ble methods have been proposed to address this issue. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating synthetic data to balance imbalanced datasets for vari- ous data types. This project investigates the efficacy of using GANs to create synthetic data, that can balance imbalanced datasets. The aim is to use GANs to produce synthetic data that can enhance the minority class, thereby increasing the number of under-represented samples in the dataset. The effectiveness of GANs is evaluated by comparing the performance of models trained on the original im- balanced dataset and the balanced dataset generated using GANs
**My Contribution - Balancing Image Data using BAGAN **
The code contribution focuses on implementing the BAGAN architecture to address the imbalanced nature of the Chest X-Ray image dataset. By utilizing BAGAN, we aim to generate synthetic image data that rebalances the dataset,
**Key Objectives:**
Implement BAGAN architecture for generating synthetic data.
Train the BAGAN model on the imbalanced Chest X-Ray image dataset.
Evaluate the effectiveness of BAGAN-generated synthetic data by comparing model performance on the original imbalanced dataset and the balanced dataset produced using BAGAN.
**Output**
BAGAN generated X-ray images:
